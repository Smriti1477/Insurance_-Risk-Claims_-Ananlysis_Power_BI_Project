## ** Objectives**

- Analyze claim frequency and severity by different risk factors.  
- Understand which policy types or segments have higher risk.  
- Track time-trends in claims (e.g. monthly, yearly).  
- Identify anomalies, outliers or potential fraud indicators.  
- Provide dashboards with key KPIs (e.g., Loss Ratio, Claim Cost per Policy, Average Claim Value).  
- Enable decision-makers to filter by product type, region, policy duration, etc.
